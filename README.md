# Single-Phase-Voltage-Source-Inverter
##This is a lab project on course "Power Electronics and Industrial Drives"

""_Components Used_""
- Arduino UNO
- Four BC-548 BJT as gated Switch

It's just a simple single phase inverter, where just a basic inverting mechanism has done using Single PWM technique.
But pwm signal has been generated by controlling on-time and off-time rather than using Arduino's regular pwm feature (analogWrite).
